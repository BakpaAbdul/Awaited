# Awaited

**A GradCafe-style anonymous scholarship results tracker.**

Scholarship timelines are opaque. Applicants have no way to know whether decisions have been sent out, whether silence means rejection, or whether others with similar profiles got through. Awaited fixes that.

Users anonymously report their scholarship application outcomes (Applied → Interview → Waitlisted → Accepted/Rejected), and others can browse and search that data to gauge timelines and chances.

## Features

### For applicants
- **Anonymous result submission** — report scholarship name, status, date, study level, country. Optionally share GPA, nationality, field of study.
- **Search & filter** — find results by scholarship name, country, study level, or status.
- **Scholarship pages** — click any scholarship to see its dedicated page with a visual status breakdown.
- **Discussion threads** — comment anonymously on any result to ask questions or share tips.

### For admins
- **Supabase Auth admin login** — real email/password session instead of a browser-only shared password.
- **Moderation queue** — pending results and comments can be approved, rejected, hidden, or deleted.
- **Content moderation** — hide spam/fake submissions, delete entries, remove individual comments.
- **Analytics dashboard** — status distribution, top scholarships, submissions by month, country and level breakdowns.
- **Verified scholarship list** — manage a canonical list of scholarship names. Submissions with unverified names are flagged for review. The submit form autocompletes from the verified list.

| Hosting | Vercel (planned) | Auto-deploys from GitHub |
| Database | Supabase | PostgreSQL + Edge Functions |
| Styling | Inline styles | No CSS framework dependency |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or later
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- A GitHub account

### Local development

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/awaited.git
cd awaited

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

The app will be running at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Persistence
Awaited now has two data modes:

- **Supabase mode** — shared backend for all users when `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are configured
- **Browser-local fallback** — local persistence when Supabase is not configured

The browser-local mode keeps the app usable during setup, but real multi-user data requires Supabase mode. If Supabase is configured but temporarily unreachable, the app now falls back clearly and tells you that the current session is local-only.

### Admin access
Awaited now supports two admin modes:

- **Supabase mode** — real admin sign-in through Supabase Auth
- **Browser-local fallback** — local password only for offline/dev fallback

In browser-local fallback, this uses `VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.

In Supabase mode, moderation routes through the authenticated `admin-actions` Edge Function.

### Supabase Setup
1. Create a Supabase project.
2. Run the SQL in [supabase/schema.sql](/Users/abdulbaari/Scholartrack/supabase/schema.sql) in the Supabase SQL editor.
3. Optionally run [supabase/seed.sql](/Users/abdulbaari/Scholartrack/supabase/seed.sql) if you want the shared backend to start with the same beta sample reports as the frontend fallback.
4. Deploy the moderation Edge Function from [supabase/functions/admin-actions/index.ts](/Users/abdulbaari/Scholartrack/supabase/functions/admin-actions/index.ts).
5. Deploy the public posting Edge Function from [supabase/functions/public-actions/index.ts](/Users/abdulbaari/Scholartrack/supabase/functions/public-actions/index.ts).
6. Create `.env.local` from `.env.example` and fill in:

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
VITE_SUPABASE_ADMIN_FUNCTION=admin-actions
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLIC_FUNCTION=public-actions
VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=your-turnstile-site-key
```

7. Set the Supabase secret `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` if you want real CAPTCHA verification.
8. Restart the dev server.

When those env vars are present, Awaited switches from browser-local storage to the shared Supabase backend automatically. Realtime updates are enabled for results, comments, moderation queue state, and verified scholarship names.

### Vercel Deployment
Your frontend stays on Vercel. The backend lives in Supabase.

1. Keep deploying the React app to Vercel as usual.
2. In Vercel project settings, add:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ADMIN_FUNCTION=admin-actions`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLIC_FUNCTION=public-actions`
   - `VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=your-turnstile-site-key`
3. Redeploy the site.

Once those env vars are present in Vercel, the deployed frontend will use the shared Supabase backend instead of browser-local storage.

### Abuse Controls
The current backend now enforces several public-posting controls:

- anonymous posting goes through `public-actions` instead of direct table inserts
- suspicious results/comments can be auto-queued as `pending`
- rate limits apply to repeated submissions from the same browser fingerprint
- links and noisy spam patterns are blocked in public notes and comments
- Turnstile can be enabled with `VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` and `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY`

You should still replace any test Turnstile keys with real ones before a wider launch.
